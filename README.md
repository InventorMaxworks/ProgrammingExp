# ProgrammingExp
This is my repistory for my resume. Its still under development but the repository will showcase my completion of "bite-sized" miscellaneous projects over the course of both 2021 and 2022. Most of these projects aim to display my area of knowledge and expertise particularly with python and perhaps C# at some point If I think its worthy enough to showcase. I plan on expanding this rep to show my experience in  C++, C, and java sometime in the future. Other than knowledge in language, this aims to show my knowledge in general programming knowledge (OOP, recurision, exception handling, Searching and Algorithim sorting, etc.. etc..).

TL;DR this repistory will act as a hub for all of my smaller, bite-sized projects. Projects that solely aim to showcase a mastery on a very, very specific topic

(Note - 11/21/22) past projects may be updated frequentley. In other words, they may be removed, added or moved to a new repistory for mostly organization-sake. Anything I see fit really. The date that reads on the repistory may or may not be accurate to the original date of publishing of said projects so please keep that in note.

(Note - 12/1/22) For the most part, I will not be handing out the source file for these micro-projects since they aren't really worth the effort and also for maximum convience; I will have the code on a github file instead so its easy to see at anytime. Keep in mind, they are exception to the rule. Some projects like my recurison project will come in a pycharm file simply because the UTC-8 text file is too big.

(Note - 12/23/22) Under recent highlight of events, I've decided that I will be privating this repiostery as its caused some confusion and conflict with my university. If allowed by my university, I will make it public again possibley.
